How to use:

* Copy either init.d/wbcrxd or init.d/wbctxd to /etc/init.d
* Update init scripts: sudo update-rc.d wbcrxd start

Now either the rx.sh or tx.sh scripts should start automatically at boot.

Note that these scripts are expected to be under /home/pi/wifibroadcast_fpv_scripts . Otherwise you would need to adapt the wbcrxd and wbctx.
